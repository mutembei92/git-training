1.The Principle of Horizontal Spatial Unity:This principle implies that each region constitutes a sub-system of the whole regional system. Therefore, all the regions works together in case of planning. Thus, planning for any region cannot be done in isolation from the planning of the adjacent region.

2.The Principle of Space-time Continuum: This principle implies that spatial reality is as true as temporal entity. Therefore, for the planning of a region, time frame is also taken into consideration

3.The Principle of Equilibrium between Social Desirability and Economic
Viability: This principle implies that while planning for comprehensive development of all regions, the regional planner has to maintain a balance between what is socially and economically desirable and viable during one point of time for a particular region

4.The Principle of Ecological Equilibrium: The regional planning should make the ecology and environment sustainable. In other words, all developments in a region should be carried out without disturbing the ecological balance of any region , i.e in a sustainable way and in a friendly manner.
